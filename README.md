Student Result Management System
Description
The Student Result Management System is a Java-based application built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface, JDBC for connecting to an SQL database, and SQL for data storage and retrieval. This application provides an efficient and user-friendly way to manage student result data, including storing student information, recording their exam scores, and generating result reports.

Features
Login System: The system includes a secure login system to restrict access to authorized users only. Each user has a unique username and password to access the system.

Student Information: The application allows administrators to add, edit, and delete student information, including details such as name, roll number, class, and contact information.

Result Management: Teachers or administrators can input and update students' exam scores and grades for various subjects.

Result Calculation: The system automatically calculates the total marks, average, and percentage of each student based on the entered exam scores.

Result Reports: It enables the generation of result reports for individual students or entire classes. These reports display the student's details along with their exam scores and final results.

Technologies Used
Java Swing: Java Swing is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application. It provides a set of tools and components for building interactive and visually appealing windows, buttons, forms, etc.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is employed to establish a connection between the Java application and the SQL database. It facilitates the execution of SQL queries and transactions.

SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is utilized to design and manage the relational database. It handles operations such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, and retrieving information.

How to Run
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3.Set up an SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
4.Create the required database tables using the provided SQL schema.
5.Update the database connection parameters in the Java code to match your database configuration.
6.Compile the Java code and run the application.
